# fakos
Experimental game on dreams and dogs, implemented in Lua.

## Current state: inactive
Since this project was implemented, there were changes in the Love2D engine that broke the game somehow; it seems, now, that the game would be more effectively implemented using another engine (as Unity). Until then, the project is on hold, and this repository is being used to preserve the legacy code.
